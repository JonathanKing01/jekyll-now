I've made this site to upload interesting projects and assignments that I have finished or am working on. I'll be adding tabs to organise posts into game related content, uni assignments, AI algorithms, and other potential areas of interest I may end up working on. For now this blog page can the be the homepage for the site, where you can see all my amazing work! :wink: :ok_hand:
