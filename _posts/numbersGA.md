Created  a basic genetic algorith to test out the evolutionary process. 
Ill describe each step below, then give a link to the file on git for python 3
 
 Goal: The algorithm will recieve a target number as input,
 And will output a mathematically valid formula equal in value to the target number.
 Structure:
 1 Recieve target number.
 2. Call the solve function, which will take 3 adittional inputs, population size, formula length and number of iterations before failure
 3. The solve function will output the answer.
 
 Solve function 
 Structure:
 1.
