Hi! My name is Jono King, and I am a software student come indie dev. I've been working on projects in and out of school and uni for a couple of years now and I've decided to set up a website to showcase some of my work. My main interests include AI technology and Video Game design. You'll also find some of my uni work on this site: any assignments or projects that I think were interseting, that I'm allowed to upload, will go here.

### More Information

I live in Auckland, New Zealand, and I am in the second year of a Computer Systems engineering degree at the University of Auckland.
